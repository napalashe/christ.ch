## HOW I WENT ABOUT PROJECT
I tried to create this program in a variety of different ways until I realized the array function was simply the most optimal way to go about the project.
Using the array to store countries I could then perform the switch statements to hold language and specilaiztion until the rand function assigned a country.
My programming approach was solo, so I failed many times writing the code until I finally was able to model something that could be built upon.
I first attemped to do the blackjack project but without any one to help me I wasted a lot of time until I switched as I could not get everything to work perfectly before the deadline.
The switch function was taken out multiple times to add the boolean structure butI could not function the rand without it, such I ended up abondoning the idea entirley and created a simple program that functions all the materials.
## AUTHORS
Me, myself and I. Working solo is not optimal and I would have appreciated feedback throughout the process.
## HOW TO USE CODE
I set up the code to be very user friendly, it guides you through the process and even tries to engage with you depending on your selection. One thing I wish I added was a return function however with switch I would have to creat an if else functions instead.
Other than that the function should operate perfectly! It guides you through and will display the probability at the end.
